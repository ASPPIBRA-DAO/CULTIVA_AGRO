## INTRODUCTION

- We are ASPPIBRA - Association of Property Owners and Owners in Brazil. We are a non-profit civil association, founded on 09/04/2016, in the State of Rio de Janeiro-RJ, formed by professionals, liberals and citizens who wish to contribute to the socio-economic development of modern society. We aim to defend and represent the interests of owners and property owners in Brazil. ASPPIBRA was founded with the aim of accelerating digital inclusion, facilitating Brazilian citizens' access to resources and services through new technologies and making land regularization in Brazil a reality for everyone, even those who do not have access to information. Knowing well the difficulties faced throughout the national territory, we seek to provide quality support to all citizens with regard to Private Property, real estate registration, licensing, access to information and exploitation of natural resources in a sustainable way.

- From the Mundo Digital project, we aim to bring modernization, digital inclusion, financial security, environmental preservation and sustainable energy generation through the combination of technologies such as blockchain and
web 3. With this, we want to accelerate land regularization, offering financial incentives to expand agricultural production in a sustainable manner and recover degraded areas. This approach makes it possible to build a new digital world that unites the environment and innovation.
